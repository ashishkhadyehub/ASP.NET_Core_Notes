        <li>The .csproj file, or C# Project file, encapsulates project configuration, dependency management, build settings, and project structure within a structured XML format.</li>
        <li>It defines crucial aspects such as the project's name, target framework, dependencies via &lt;PackageReference&gt; elements, build configurations, and the organization of source files and resources.</li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>What is Middleware in ASP.NET Core?</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>Middleware in ASP.NET Core refers to components that form the request processing pipeline. Each middleware component handles an aspect of HTTP request processing, such as authentication, logging, or routing.</li>
        <li>Middleware is added to the request pipeline in the Configure method of the Startup class using the UseMiddleware extension method of the IApplicationBuilder interface. They are executed sequentially in the order they are added.</li>
        <li>ASP.NET Core provides built-in middleware for common tasks, but developers can also create custom middleware to implement specific application logic, allowing for flexibility and extensibility in request processing.</li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>What is MVC, explain working?</summary>
    MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, which is a software architectural pattern commonly used in web development.
    <ul>
        <li><b>Model:</b> The model represents the data and business logic of the application. It encapsulates the application's data and behavior, and it is responsible for managing the state of the application. Models can interact with databases, web services, or other sources of data.</li>
        <li><b>View:</b> The view is responsible for rendering the user interface. It presents the data to the user and handles user interactions such as button clicks or form submissions. Views are typically HTML templates that are populated with data from the model.</li>
        <li><b>Controller:</b> The controller acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It receives user input from the view, processes it using the model, and then updates the view with the results. Controllers handle HTTP requests, invoke appropriate actions on the model, and select the appropriate view to render the response.</li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
    
    <summary>What is the use of Controller class?</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>Controller classes in ASP.NET Core manage incoming HTTP requests from clients and contain action methods to process specific requests.</li>
        <li>Controllers interact with the application's model to perform data manipulation or retrieval tasks, ensuring separation of concerns in the MVC architecture.</li>
        <li>Controllers define route templates using attributes, determining which action methods respond to which URLs. They return views or data directly to clients, facilitating the dynamic generation of web content.</li>
        
    </ul>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>What is the difference between action method and non action method?</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>Action methods in ASP.NET Core controllers are public methods designated to handle incoming HTTP requests.</li>
        <li>Non-action methods within controller classes are public methods not intended to handle HTTP requests.</li>
    </ul>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>What are the razor views in asp.net core?</summary>
    Razor views in ASP.NET Core are a type of view template used for generating HTML dynamically based on data provided by the controller. Razor is a markup syntax that allows you to embed server-side code (C# or VB.NET) directly into your HTML markup, enabling the creation of dynamic web pages. Razor views have the extension .cshtml and are a key component of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern used in ASP.NET Core web applications.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>What is Dependency Injection?</summary>
    Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in software development, including ASP.NET Core, to achieve loose coupling between components and promote modular, testable, and maintainable code. In DI, a class depends on interfaces or abstractions rather than concrete implementations. Instead of creating its dependencies internally, a class's dependencies are "injected" into it from the outside, typically via constructor parameters or properties.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>What is EF Core?</summary>
    Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is a powerful and versatile object-relational mapping (ORM) framework developed by Microsoft. It is designed to simplify the process of working with relational databases in .NET applications by providing a high-level abstraction over the underlying database schema.

<details>
    <summary>What is Model Binding in asp.net core?</summary>
    Model binding in ASP.NET Core is a mechanism that automatically maps data from HTTP request parameters to action method parameters or properties of a model class. It simplifies the process of handling user input by eliminating the need for manual extraction and conversion of data from the request. When a request is received, ASP.NET Core's model binding system inspects the request data and attempts to match it to the parameters of the corresponding action method, converting the data to the appropriate types as needed. This allows developers to focus on implementing business logic rather than parsing incoming data, enhancing productivity and maintainability of web applications.
</details>
<details>
    <summary>Explain binding from form values</summary>
    Binding from form values in ASP.NET Core refers to the process of mapping data submitted through HTML forms to the properties of model classes in the server-side code. When a form is submitted, ASP.NET Core's model binding system automatically extracts the values from the form fields based on their names and matches them to the properties of the designated model class. This simplifies the handling of user input, as developers can define strongly-typed model classes representing the structure of their data, and rely on the framework to populate these models with the corresponding form values. This enables efficient and consistent data handling in web applications, reducing the amount of manual parsing and conversion code required.
</details>
<details>
    <summary>Explain binding through query string</summary>
    Binding through the query string in ASP.NET Core involves automatically extracting and mapping data from the URL's query parameters to action method parameters or properties of a model class in the server-side code.
</details>
<details>
    <summary>Explain binding through route data</summary>
    Binding through route data in ASP.NET Core involves automatically extracting and mapping data from the URL's route parameters to action method parameters or properties of a model class in the server-side code, facilitating seamless integration of URL parameters into application logic.

    <summary>How we can implement security in asp.net core?</summary>
    Implementing security in ASP.NET Core involves several strategies and practices to ensure the application is protected against various threats. Key aspects include:
    <ul>
        <li>Authentication and Authorization</li>
        <li>Data Protection : Encrypt sensitive data in transit using HTTPS by configuring SSL/TLS.</li>
        <li>Anti-Forgery Tokens : Protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by using anti-forgery tokens in forms. ASP.NET Core provides built-in support for generating and validating these tokens.</li>
        <li>Middleware and Security Headers</li>

    </ul>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>Explain how routing is handled in asp.net? </summary>
    Routing in ASP.NET Core is a system for mapping incoming HTTP requests to specific endpoints in an application, such as controllers and actions. It is configured and managed through a middleware component in the application's request processing pipeline.

    <summary>Explain validation in asp.net core</summary>
    Refer <a href="session13.html" target="_blank">session 13</a>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>What is anti-forgery attack and how to prevent it in asp.net core application?</summary>
    An anti-forgery attack, often referred to as a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack, is a malicious exploit where unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the web application trusts. ASP.NET Core provides built-in mechanisms to prevent such attacks by requiring an anti-forgery token for any state-changing operations like form submissions. This token, generated server-side, is included in both the form data (hidden field) and as a cookie. When the server receives a request, it verifies the token from the form against the token in the cookie, ensuring both originate from the same client. To implement this, you add the @Html.AntiForgeryToken() helper in your forms and decorate your controller actions with the [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] attribute. This helps to confirm that the form submissions are legitimate and not forged.
</details>
<details>
    <summary>Explain model state in asp.net core</summary>
    In ASP.NET Core, Model State is a mechanism used to track the state of model binding and to validate the input received from users. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that the data submitted by users conforms to the expected data types and validation rules defined in the model.<br>
    The ModelState object contains two key properties:
    <ul>
        <li><b>IsValid:</b> This property indicates whether the model binding and validation were successful. It returns true if there are no errors; otherwise, it returns false.</li>
        <li><b>Errors:</b> This property contains a collection of errors that occurred during the binding and validation processes.</li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>Explain use of ViewModels?</summary>
    ViewModels play a crucial role in ASP.NET Core applications by acting as a bridge between the domain models and the views. They are specifically designed to contain the data that a view requires to render, which may include data from multiple domain models or additional properties that are only relevant to the view.
